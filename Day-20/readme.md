# Writing Clean Code: JavaScript Style Guide

## Overview
A JavaScript style guide is a set of standards that outlines how JavaScript code should be written and organized. This guide aims to help developers maintain consistency and simplicity in their code. Just as human languages have syntax, JavaScript has its own syntax that should be adhered to for clarity and maintainability.

## Why We Need a Style Guide
When coding alone, you may write code in any manner that works. However, working in a team of multiple developers on a shared codebase can lead to messy and hard-to-manage code if there are no established guidelines. A style guide ensures that everyone adheres to the same standards, improving readability and maintainability.

You can either develop your own guidelines or adopt well-established ones. Some of the most common JavaScript style guides include:

### Common JavaScript Style Guides
- **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**: One of the most popular guides, covering nearly every aspect of JavaScript. Itâ€™s widely adopted and known for its clarity.
- **JavaScript Standard Style Guide**: A minimalist style guide that omits semicolons.
- **Google JavaScript Style Guide**: A comprehensive guide worth reviewing.

## JavaScript Coding Conventions
In this challenge, we adhered to general JavaScript coding conventions, which help achieve the following:

- Writing clean code
- Improving code readability
- Enhancing code reusability and maintainability

### Key Conventions
- **Naming and Declaration Rules**: Consistent rules for naming variables and functions.
- **Whitespace and Indentation**: Guidelines on the use of whitespace, indentation, and comments.
- **Programming Practices**: Best practices for writing code.

### Conventions Used in 30DaysOfJavaScript
In this challenge, we followed standard conventions with personal preferences:
- **Variable and Function Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, and ensure all variable names start with a letter.
- **Constants**: Use `const` for constants, arrays, objects, and functions.
- **Quotes**: Prefer single quotes or backticks over double quotes.
- **Semicolons**: Semicolons are optional but were omitted for personal preference.
- **Whitespace**: Include space around arithmetic and assignment operators, and after commas.
- **Arrow Functions**: Prefer arrow functions over traditional function declarations.
- **Explicit Returns**: Use explicit returns instead of implicit returns for single-line functions.
- **Trailing Commas**: Avoid trailing commas in the last value of an object.
- **Operators**: Use shorthand operators (+=, -=, etc.) instead of their longer equivalents.
- **Console Logging**: Tag console logs for easier identification.

### Examples
#### Variables
```javascript
let firstName = 'Asabeneh';
let lastName = 'Yetayeh';
let country = 'Finland';
let city = 'Helsinki';

const PI = Math.PI;
const gravity = 9.81;
```

#### Arrays
We use plural names for arrays:
```javascript
const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook'];
const numbers = [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100];
const countries = ['Finland', 'Denmark', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Iceland'];
const languages = ['Amharic', 'Arabic', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish'];
const skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Python'];
const fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'];
const vegetables = ['Tomato', 'Potato', 'Cabbage', 'Onion', 'Carrot'];
```

#### Functions
We prefer using arrow functions:
```javascript
const printFullName = (firstName, lastName) => firstName + ' ' + lastName;
const square = (n) => n * n;
const hexaColor = () => {
    const str = '0123456789abcdef';
    let hexa = '#';
    let index;
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        index = Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length);
        hexa += str[index];
    }
    return hexa;
};
```

#### Loops
Different loop types are used consistently:
```javascript
const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook'];

// Using for loop
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i].toUpperCase());
}

// Using for...of loop
for (const name of names) {
    console.log(name.toUpperCase());
}

// Using forEach
names.forEach((name) => console.log(name.toUpperCase()));
```

#### Objects
We declare objects using `const`:
```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: 'Asabeneh',
    lastName: 'Yetayeh',
    age: 250,
    country: 'Finland',
    city: 'Helsinki',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Node', 'MongoDB', 'Python', 'D3.js'],
    isMarried: true,
};

// Iterating through object keys
for (const key in person) {
    console.log(key, person[key]);
}
```

#### Conditionals
We use clear conditional structures:
```javascript
if (condition) {
    // code runs for truthy condition
} else {
    // code runs for false condition
}
```

### Conclusion
Consistency is key when following a style guide. Adhering to a set of programming paradigms and design patterns can significantly enhance code readability. Write your code in an organized fashion to facilitate ease of understanding for yourself and others in the future.
