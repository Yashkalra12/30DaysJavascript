## 30 Days of JavaScript

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Yash Kalra, a Full Stack Developer passionate about web development. Iâ€™ve embarked on a 30-day journey to strengthen my JavaScript skills and revisit web development fundamentals.

### What is 30 Days of JavaScript?

For the next 30 days, I will be diving deep into JavaScript concepts by:
- **Going through documentation**: Studying official resources and exploring advanced features.
- **Solving exercises**: Tackling various problems to apply what I learn.
- **Committing daily**: Documenting my progress and showcasing my consistency.

This challenge is not only about revising my skills but also about building discipline and demonstrating my dedication to continuous learning. I hope this project inspires others to embark on their own learning journeys!

Feel free to check out my daily commits and see how Iâ€™m progressing. Iâ€™d love to connect with others who are passionate about web development!

### What to Expect

- **Daily updates**: Commit messages and explanations of what Iâ€™ve learned or built each day.
- **Challenges and exercises**: Solutions to various JavaScript problems.
- **Learning resources**: Links to documentation and tutorials Iâ€™m using.

Letâ€™s code together and grow our skills! ðŸš€
